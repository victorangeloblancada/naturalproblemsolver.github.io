I am a full stack AI developer who has overseen projects to completion. I specialize in data science and machine learning using Python, R, and C but am also knowledgable in Java and web development. I am equally comfortable as an individual contributor or as a project manager.

My achievements include:

- Developing automated flu tracking software to guide the Australian marketing campaign schedule for a leading FMCG company's cough and flu medication. The tracker automatically sends the marketing team an alert email whenever a flu outbreak is predicted to begin, giving them ample time to prepare inventory and boost advertising.
- Reaching the national finals of the Trend Micro Big Data Programming competition by creating a Natural Language Processing bot that takes in text, summarizes the general ideas, and identifies logical and factual inconsistencies.
- Developing automated media optimization algorithms resulting in client sales lift of up to 13%. The algorithm applies linear and non-linear optimization to a predictive model of client sales to recommend an annual media spending plan by channel on a weekly level.
