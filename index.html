		<h1>Data Scientist</h1>
		<!--
		<p>We live in the golden age of data. It is estimated that 90% of all data in the world today was created in the last two years alone.</p>
		<p>This simultaneously represents an opportunity and a threat.</p>
		<p>There is a massive opportunity to leverage big data to improve decision making. As more data is collected on how organizations run their businesses and how their consumers behave, driving the bottom line can be reduced to an engineering problem, with mathematical models accurately predicting what the consequences of each decision will be and informing management of the optimal course of action.</p>
		<p>With new data rapidly becoming available, it is easy to get lost in the numbers and mistake the forest for the trees. Without a data scientist to guide them, companies run the risk of either missing the obvious or coming up with misleading conclusions, both of which can be costly.</p>
		-->
		<p>Victor has a proven track record of applying predictive modeling and mathematical optimization concepts to come up with actionable solutions to real life problems, helping organizations take advantage of the opportunities opened up by the rise of the data age.</p>
		<p>Victor's achievements include:</p>
		<ul class="paragraph">
			<li>Launching and managing the Asian analytics hub to handle the data management, statistical modeling, and mathematical optimization needs of a global media conglomerate across its agencies worldwide.</li>
			<li>Guiding the $400MM USD network expansion of a regional North American telecommunications provider by running a Monte Carlo optimization which identified the optimal network layout that would maximize profits based on a customer lifetime value model.</li>
			<li>Driving client sales lift of up to 13% by developing and executing automated media optimization algorithms.</li>
			<li>Developing an automated flu tracker to guide the Australian marketing campaign schedule for a leading FMCG company's cough and flu medication.</li>
			<li>Successfully predicting the winner of the 2016 Philippine presidential elections using an econometric model six months before the election.</li>

		<h1>Strategy Consultant</h1>
		<p>Victor has worked closely with C-level executives on strategy and business transformation projects.</p>
		<p>Victor's achievements include:</p>
		<ul class="paragraph">
			<li>Overseeing the $400MM USD network expansion of a regional North American telecommunications provider while working at the client headquarters. This was done by running a Monte Carlo optimization which identified the optimal network layout that would maximize profits based on a customer lifetime value model.</li>
			<li>Generating $9MM USD in cost savings for a US manufacturing company through on-site strategic sourcing and vendor contract renegotiation.</li>
			<li>Driving client sales lift by up to 13% by developing and executing automated media optimization algorithms that optimize media spending for sales instead of traditional metrics such as reach.</li>

		<h1>AI Developer</h1>
		<p>Victor is a full stack AI developer who has overseen projects to completion. He specializes in data science and machine learning using Python, R, and C but is also knowledgable in Java and web development. He is equally comfortable as an individual contributor or as a project manager.</p>
		<p>Victor's achievements include:</p>
		<ul class="paragraph">
			<li>Developing automated flu tracking software to guide the Australian marketing campaign schedule for a leading FMCG company's cough and flu medication. The tracker automatically sends the marketing team an alert email whenever a flu outbreak is predicted to begin, giving them ample time to prepare inventory and boost advertising.</li>
			<li>Reaching the national finals of the Trend Micro Big Data Programming competition by creating a Natural Language Processing bot that takes in text, summarizes the general ideas, and identifies logical and factual inconsistencies.</li>
			<li>Developing automated media optimization algorithms resulting in client sales lift of up to 13%. The algorithm applies linear and non-linear optimization to a predictive model of client sales to recommend an annual media spending plan by channel on a weekly level.</li>
