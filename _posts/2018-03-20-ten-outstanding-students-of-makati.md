The city government of Makati named this yearâ€™s Ten Outstanding Students of Makati, who all received plaques of recognition, medallions, and checks worth P15,000 each. I myself was named one of the Ten Outstanding Students of Makati back in 2009. The newspaper article covering the 2009 Ten Outstanding Students of Makati can be found below.
