I redesigned my personal website earlier this year. The previous iteration worked well as an online resume slash blogging platform. It also looked good on desktop but its functionality as a place to showcase some of my code and its ability to adapt to smaller mobile phone screens felt lacking. This prompted me to fire up Sublime Text and modify the site.

In this blog post, I will explain what I kept, what I changed, and why.

## What I Kept

### Hosting on GitHub Pages


## What I Changed

### Ergonomic Navigation

### Syntax Highlighting

### Magazine Cover Headers
